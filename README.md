# Fake-News-Classification
Machine Learning Project at UoFM

I will use a dataset from Kaggle for fake/real news classification and apply Decision Trees, Random Forest, Na√Øve Bayes and KNN algorithms, and compare their performance. Finally, I will create a model using one of the above algorithms that classifies fake/real news to the best.
